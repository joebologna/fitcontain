User prompt 2 of 3 - 4/28/2025, 2:21:37 AM:
I have a box with a fixed aspect ratio inside another box with a variable aspect ratio. The inner box needs to be centered and scaled to fit in the larger box. What is the formula to position a point in the larger box such that it stays in the same location in the smaller box as the larger box changes shape?

GPT-4o mini:
To position a point in the larger box such that it stays in the same location in the smaller box as the larger box changes shape, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Boxes**:
   - Let the dimensions of the larger box be $W_L$ (width) and $H_L$ (height).
   - Let the dimensions of the smaller box (fixed aspect ratio) be $W_S$ and $H_S$.

2. **Calculate the Scaling Factor**:
   - Determine the scaling factor based on the aspect ratios. The aspect ratio of the smaller box is $AR_S = \frac{W_S}{H_S}$.
   - The aspect ratio of the larger box is $AR_L = \frac{W_L}{H_L}$.

   To maintain the aspect ratio of the smaller box while scaling, you can calculate the scaling factor $S$ as follows:
   $$
   S = \min\left(\frac{W_L}{W_S}, \frac{H_L}{H_S}\right)
   $$

3. **Calculate the New Dimensions of the Smaller Box**:
   - The new dimensions of the smaller box after scaling will be:
   $$
   W_{S'} = W_S \times S
   $$
   $$
   H_{S'} = H_S \times S
   $$

4. **Center the Smaller Box in the Larger Box**:
   - To center the smaller box within the larger box, calculate the position $(X, Y)$ of the top-left corner of the smaller box:
   $$
   X = \frac{W_L - W_{S'}}{2}
   $$
   $$
   Y = \frac{H_L - H_{S'}}{2}
   $$

5. **Positioning a Point**:
   - If you have a point $(x, y)$ in the smaller box (where $0 \leq x \leq W_S$ and $0 \leq y \leq H_S$), you can find its corresponding position $(X', Y')$ in the larger box as follows:
   $$
   X' = X + x \times S
   $$
   $$
   Y' = Y + y \times S
   $$

By following these steps, you can ensure that the point in the smaller box maintains its relative position as the larger box changes shape.

This makes sense. However, the location of points in the smaller box are represented as a percentage of the width and height of the smaller box. How do these points translate to percentages of the height and width in the larger box?

GPT-4o mini:
If the points in the smaller box are represented as percentages of its width and height, you can easily translate these percentages to the larger box by following these steps:

1. **Define the Percentages**:
   - Let $p_x$ be the percentage of the width of the smaller box (where $0 \leq p_x \leq 1$).
   - Let $p_y$ be the percentage of the height of the smaller box (where $0 \leq p_y \leq 1$).

2. **Calculate the Position in the Smaller Box**:
   - The actual position of the point in the smaller box can be calculated as:
   $$
   x = p_x \times W_S
   $$
   $$
   y = p_y \times H_S
   $$

3. **Calculate the Scaling Factor**:
   - As before, calculate the scaling factor $S$:
   $$
   S = \min\left(\frac{W_L}{W_S}, \frac{H_L}{H_S}\right)
   $$

4. **Calculate the New Dimensions of the Smaller Box**:
   - The new dimensions of the smaller box after scaling will be:
   $$
   W_{S'} = W_S \times S
   $$
   $$
   H_{S'} = H_S \times S
   $$

5. **Center the Smaller Box in the Larger Box**:
   - Calculate the position $(X, Y)$ of the top-left corner of the smaller box:
   $$
   X = \frac{W_L - W_{S'}}{2}
   $$
   $$
   Y = \frac{H_L - H_{S'}}{2}
   $$

6. **Translate to the Larger Box**:
   - Now, to find the corresponding position $(X', Y')$ in the larger box, you can use the following formulas:
   $$
   X' = X + (p_x \times W_S) \times S
   $$
   $$
   Y' = Y + (p_y \times H_S) \times S
   $$

7. **Expressing as Percentages**:
   - If you want to express the position $(X', Y')$ as percentages of the larger box's dimensions, you can calculate:
   $$
   \text{Percentage of Width in Larger Box} = \frac{X'}{W_L}
   $$
   $$
   \text{Percentage of Height in Larger Box} = \frac{Y'}{H_L}
   $$

By following these steps, you can translate the percentage-based positions from the smaller box to the larger box while maintaining the correct relative positioning.
